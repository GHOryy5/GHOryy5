### 
I mess with systems.

Sometimes that means breaking them.
Sometimes it means figuring out why they shouldn’t have broken.
Most of the time it’s just curiosity going too far.

I move between low level reality and high level ideas without asking permission.
Rust. Python. runtimes. kernels. AI infra.
They’re tools. Not my personality.

I don’t like staying in one box.
If I understand something, I get bored and go deeper or sideways.
That’s usually where the interesting stuff is.

Security is part of how I think, not the end goal.
* So is performance.
* So is incentives.
* So is asking “what happens if this is wrong”.

I learn by building things and then pushing on them until they tell the truth.
Abstractions leak.
Systems lie.
That’s where the signal is.

I think intelligence is leverage.
Human or artificial.
If we’re going to scale it, distribute it, or let it make decisions, it better be understood at the lowest level.

I’m biased toward reality over theory.
Execution over promises.
Open systems over closed ones.

If this sounds a little unhinged, that’s fine.
## It usually means there’s something worth exploring.
