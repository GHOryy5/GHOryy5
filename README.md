i like understanding systems by pushing them until the abstraction breaks.

i don’t really stay in one box. sometimes i’m working close to the metal, sometimes higher up the stack, sometimes inside AI systems  .  it depends on where things start getting weird. i’m comfortable moving between Python for speed and exploration, and Rust when i need control, safety, or performance to actually mean something.

a lot of my time goes into reading code, tracing execution, and figuring out what *really* happens at runtime — syscalls, memory behavior, scheduling, the stuff that gets hand-waved away until it matters. when something feels “too magical,” that’s usually where i start digging.

i’m drawn to complex, evolving systems: distributed setups, runtimes, models, infra that’s still being figured out. i like breaking things, fixing them, and sitting in the uncomfortable middle before there’s a clean answer.

i learn fast, switch contexts easily, and don’t love staying in one lane for too long. if there’s a hard problem, a new domain, or a system that isn’t fully understood yet, that’s usually enough to get my attention.
